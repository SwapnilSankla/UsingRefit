This application is created in C#.Net. 

This application demonstrates the basic use of Refit library.

Refit library is used for simplifying calls to the Web APIs. Using refit, you can call the WebAPI without creating HTTPClient. 
You just need to create an interface containing the Path and name of methods in the Web API controller.
